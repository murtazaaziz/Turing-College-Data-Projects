- Total actual cost.

For each location_Id from the 'workorderrouting' table for orders in January 2004.

```
SELECT locationID,							
count(DISTINCT WorkOrderID) as UniqueWorkOrders,							
count(Distinct ProductID) as UniqueProducts,							
SUM(ActualCost) as ActualCost							
FROM `tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.workorderrouting`							
WHERE ActualStartDate between '2004-01-01' AND '2004-01-31'							
GROUP BY LocationID							
ORDER BY ActualCost DESC
```


### Task 2.2

# Task 3 Query Validation
Below you will find 2 queries that need to be fixed/updated.

Doubleclick on the cell of the query and you will see it in the original format, copy it into your Bigquery interface and try to fix it there.
Once you have it fixed, copy into your spreadsheet of results among previous task results.

### Task 3.1 
Your colleague has written a query to find the list of orders connected to special offers. The query works fine but the numbers are off, investigate where the potential issue lies.

Query below:

Code:

SELECT sales_detail.SalesOrderId
      ,sales_detail.OrderQty
      ,sales_detail.UnitPrice
      ,sales_detail.LineTotal
      ,sales_detail.ProductId
      ,sales_detail.SpecialOfferID
      ,spec_offer_product.ModifiedDate
      ,spec_offer.Category
      ,spec_offer.Description

FROM `tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.salesorderdetail`  as sales_detail

left join `tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.specialofferproduct` as spec_offer_product
on sales_detail.productId = spec_offer_product.ProductID

left join `tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.specialoffer` as spec_offer
on sales_detail.SpecialOfferID = spec_offer.SpecialOfferID

order by LineTotal desc

### Task 3.2 
Your colleague has written this query to collect basic Vendor information. The query does not work, look into the query and find ways to fix it. Can you provide any feedback on how to make this query be easier to debug/read?

Query below:

Image:


Code:

SELECT a.VendorId as Id,vendor_contact.ContactId, b.ContactTypeId, a.Name, a.CreditRating, a.ActiveFlag, c.AddressId,d.City

FROM tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.Vendor as a

left join tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.vendorcontact as vendor_contact on vendor.VendorId = vendor_contact.VendorId left join tc-da1.adwentureworks_db.vendoraddress as c on a.VendorId = c.VendorId

left join tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.address as address on vendor_address.VendorId = d.VendorId
